# Waste Classification Model

This project was made for the IEEE Internal Hackathon by team 5. It is a YOLO-based object classification model to idenitify whether an object shown is to be thrown into the **Recyclable**, **Biodegradable**, or **Non-Recyclable** bins.

## Model Overview
The model has been trained on datasets from kaggle containing images of common waste items which have been manually labelled. It's final objective is to distinguish between:

- ♻️ Recyclable: Plastic bottles, cans, paper, etc.
- 🌱 Biodegradable: Food scraps, leaves, compostable materials.
- 🚯 Non-Recyclable: Styrofoam, contaminated plastics, broken ceramics, etc.

> Model Type: *[YOLO]*  
> Framework: *[PyTorch]*

The Guidelines.txt files gives a step-by-step procedure on how to make your own object identification model.

### Progress
By the end of the hack, the model will be able to identify - plastics, cardboard, and clothes. (Slow due to the bottleneck of the images being manually labelled)
