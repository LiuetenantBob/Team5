Create a workspace directory
Have all the images in a single folder on the computer

Download Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download/success
In the Anaconda Command Prompt, create a virtual environment for our YOLO model
>>conda create --name garb-env python
>>conda activate garb-env

Install Label Studio for labelling the dataset
>>pip install label-studio

Run label studio using the command
>>label-studio start
Create a new project and import your images in the "Data Import" tab
In the Labelling setup tab, choose object detection with bounding boxes
Remove the pre-existing labels and add your labels (cardboard, plastic, clothes,...) and save the project settings
Label all the images

After labelling the images, export the files along with their labels by choosing the "Export YOLO with images" option
Move this file to the workspace directory and rename it to "data"

Open the ipynb file on google collab and choose the T4 GPU runtime and connect
Move the "data.zip" file to files on google collab
Run all the cells in the file

Now to run it on your device
Download and extract the garbage_man.zip file

>>cd path/to/garbage_man
>>pip install ultralytics

To use CUDA for Pytorch, you can use the installation command from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

After CUDA is installed download a python file to read data from your webcam
>>curl -o yolo_detect.py https://www.ejtech.io/code/yolo_detect.py

To use your webcam for object recognition
>>python yolo_detect.py --model garbage_man.pt --source usb0 --resolution 1280x720 (or whatever resolution your webcam is)
